Forked from [gasovn](https://github.com/gasovn/fl_favourites/) (in turn forked from [kav2k](https://github.com/kav2k/fl_favourites) )

v0.5.3 changes:

Fixed being able to discard protected cards on mobile (/src/js/content.js)
Changed icons from rosettes to Neathy lampposts, and colour scheme from green/red to gold/silver (/src/img/ and /src/css/content.css)
